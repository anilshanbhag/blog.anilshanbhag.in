      <description>&lt;p&gt;Elections are a treat for data enthusiasts. This elections, even more so ! Every single poll in the US predicted a landslide for Hillary Clinton. Below is an infographic from the New York Times:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blog.anilshanbhag.in/img/nyt-infographic.png&#34; alt=&#34;NYT Infographic&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chances of Trump winning Presidency before results started coming out was around 15% ! Everyone got it wrong and in the end he won 306 seats. Being curious, I download the data from AP and turned on my Jupyter notebook. The truth is this could have been a lot worse!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
