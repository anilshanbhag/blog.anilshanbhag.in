      <description>Reflecting on my time at IB, some of the key lessons I learnt (in no particular order)
 Use Jira  Thats it! use jira if you have more than 1 team. Give the team a goal using epics, track all feature rollouts, bugs, contributions per employee, etc.
 Employee Morale and Churn  Startups go through waves. Sometime it feels like you are killing it. Close a new customer, launch a new product, land a great hire, etc.</description>

      <description>Sam Altman in his How To Be Successful had the following to say about focus
6. Focus Focus is a force multiplier on work. Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</description>
