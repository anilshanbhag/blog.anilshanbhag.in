Sam Altman in his `How To Be Successful` had the following to say about focus

```
6. Focus

Focus is a force multiplier on work.

Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter.

Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly. I have yet to meet a slow-moving person who is very successful.
```

Focus is an incredible force. I have found many times that working with full focus for a day 
gets more work done than without focus work for a week. Despite the huge benefits, maintaing focus is hard! 
When your work is on the computer, it is hard not to want to peep into Twitter to see what is happening or open
Youtube to checkout a few videos. 

To combat this, as a first step I have started measuring number of webpages visited per day and look at aggregate statistics to figure out where I spent my time. Below is the chart for the past month.

I used the History Trends Unlimited extension to load and graph the data. As a rule of thumb, a day with number of visits below 1500 is a productive day. In the past 30 days, 10 days had number of visits above 1500. Hoping in the next 30 days the number is much lower :)
